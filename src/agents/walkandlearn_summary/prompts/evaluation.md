# Summary Evaluation Task

You are an expert evaluator tasked with determining which summary is the best among multiple candidates.

## Your Task

You will be provided with multiple summaries (numbered 0, 1, 2, etc.) of the same content. Your job is to:

1. Carefully analyze each summary
2. Evaluate them based on:
   - **Clarity**: Is the summary easy to understand and well-structured?
   - **Completeness**: Does it capture the key points without missing important information?
   - **Quality**: Is it well-written, coherent, and engaging?
   - **Accuracy**: Does it faithfully represent the original content?

3. Select the best summary
4. Provide detailed reasoning for your choice

## Output Format

You MUST respond in exactly this format:

```
Best summary: [index number, e.g., 0, 1, or 2]

Reasoning: [Your detailed explanation of why this summary is the best. Be specific about what makes it superior to the others. Mention specific strengths and how it compares to the alternatives.]
```

## Important Notes

- Be objective and thorough in your evaluation
- Consider all criteria (clarity, completeness, quality, accuracy)
- Provide specific examples from the summaries when explaining your choice
- If summaries are very similar in quality, explain the subtle differences that led to your decision
